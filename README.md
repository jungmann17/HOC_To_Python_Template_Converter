# HOC_To_Python_Template_Converter
Convert a NEURON Cell Builder HOC Template to a Python Template Instantly.

c10261_template.hoc is the input file that is converted to a Python file which is output as c10261_template.py

HOC_To_Python.py is just a big parser/formatting script that reads each line of the HOC file and then determines what to do. This was built to work for any Cell Builder HOC template that you create from scratch or Cell Builder HOC template that was built from a NeuroMorpho file that was downloaded from NeuroMorpho.org.
